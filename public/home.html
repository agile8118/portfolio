        <p>I am a software engineer specializing in web development with over 6 years of experience and I am studying
          part-time Computer Science at the university.
          During the past 6 years, I have spent a tremendous amount of time learning and practicing computer
          programming, algorithms and data structures, problem-solving and building and launching real-world products
          online. </p>
        <p>
          I always stick to lifetime learning during my career, and I am constantly learning about core computer
          concepts, new technologies, how to write better code and how to structure and scale gigantic web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am so into art that I spend hours drawing, photographing, designing and music is one of my greatest passion.
          I believe that software development is bind with art and to be a good software engineer you also need to be a
          good artist. Just my personal opinion :)

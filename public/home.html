        <p>I am a software engineer specializing in web development with over 4 years of experience and I am studying
          part-time Computer Science at the university.
          During the past 4 years, I have spent a tremendous amount of time learning and practicing computer
          programming, algorithms and data structures, problem-solving and building and launching real-world products
          online. </p>
        <p>
          I strongly believe in lifetime learning and during my career, I am constantly learning about core computer
          concepts, new technologies, how to write better code and how to structure and scale gigantic web applications.

                possible, I use CSS frameworks written by others like bootstrap, material UI, etc.
                And as for JavaScript, I am an expert in React and I use it all the time to power rich front end
                applications.

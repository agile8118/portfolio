        <h1 class="heading-primary u-margin-bottom-xs">Introducing myself</h1>
        <p>I am a software engineer specializing in web development with over 4 years of experience and I am studying
          part-time Computer Science at the university.
          During the past 4 years, I have spent a tremendous amount of time learning and practicing computer
          programming, algorithms and data structures, problem-solving and building and launching real-world products
          online. </p>
        <p>
          I strongly believe in lifetime learning and during my career, I am constantly learning about core computer
          concepts, new technologies, how to write better code and how to structure and scale gigantic web applications.

                <strong>Front-end Development: </strong>I develop responsive, modern looking front ends. Most of the
                time I develope my own CSS frameworks, and in cases that the project needs to be done as fast as
                possible, I use CSS frameworks written by others like bootstrap, material UI, etc.
                And as for JavaScript, I am an expert in React and I use it all the time to power rich front end
                applications.

                <strong>Back-end Development: </strong>For backend servers most of the time I use Node.js, Python, and
                C++ for cases that performance is critical.
                Security, scalability, and performance are things I keep in mind when I am developing backend systems.

                I can deploy and maintain complex web applications and keep track of their security, SEO, performance,
                cross-browser support and more.

                I use C++ and Python for developing these kinds of useful software.
